      "A Delaware judge’s decision to void the pay package that helped make Elon Musk the world’s richest person leaves Tesla’s board with some difficult decisions to make. \n",

      "2\n",
      "Tesla’s profit from sales of electric cars slumped in the last three months of last year because of price cuts intended to thwart increasingly intense competition, the company said on Wednesday as it warned of a tough year ahead. \n",
      " A tax benefit boosted quarterly earnings, but that masked a decline in earnings from carmaking caused by intensifying competition.\n",
      "3\n",
      "Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, suffered a stunning rebuke Tuesday when a Delaware judge voided the pay package that helped make him a billionaire many times over and the world’s wealthiest human being. \n",
      " Shareholders had sued, arguing that Mr. Musk’s compensation — which helped make him the world’s richest person — was excessive.\n",
      "4\n",

      " The recall follows a similar move by the company in the United States to upgrade the cars’ Autopilot feature.\n",
      "6\n",
      "The rental car company Hertz will be selling about one-third of the electric vehicles in its fleet after they lost value more quickly than expected, the company said on Thursday. The drop in value is a blow to the company’s efforts to replace gasoline vehicles with cars that do not produce tailpipe emissions. \n",
      " The rental car company blamed the sharp drop in the value of electric vehicles and higher repair costs for its decision to sell 20,000 cars.\n",
      "7\n",
      "Tesla sales jumped during the last three months of 2023 after the carmaker slashed prices and customers rushed to take advantage of tax breaks on electric vehicles — provisions that will be harder to come by in 2024. \n",
      " The leading U.S. electric-vehicle maker also drew buyers eager to take advantage of government incentives that will be harder to get in 2024.\n",
      "8\n",

      "The Chinese corporate giant BYD said Monday that it sold three million battery-powered cars in 2023, its most ever, capping a turbulent year for China’s electric vehicle industry. \n",
      " Sales by BYD, the country’s dominant automaker, topped 3 million last year, including 1.6 million fully battery-powered cars. It’s a sign of China’s rapid growth in EVs.\n",
      "12\n",
      "There are more than four million electric vehicles on American roads, but fewer than 1,000 of them are heavy-duty trucks. On Tuesday, the three largest truck makers announced a push to remedy that deficit by calling on governments and utilities to help them build many more places to charge big rigs. \n",
      " Daimler, Navistar and Volvo have been criticized for not selling many electric heavy trucks, but the companies say the country first needs many more chargers.\n",
      "13\n",

      "14\n",
      "The resignation yesterday of Claudine Gay, Harvard’s first Black president and the second woman to lead the university, was tied to a mounting crisis over plagiarism allegations. But she had also been under fire for months over what critics said was an insufficient response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel. \n",
      " The resignation of Claudine Gay as Harvard’s president reopens the debate over who should run America’s elite universities.\n",
      "15\n",
      "Investors are bailing on Boeing and one of its biggest suppliers this morning after a harrowing malfunction at 16,000 feet this weekend in which a door panel sheared off a new 737 Max 9 airliner in midflight. \n",

      " The 20 best-performing hedge funds made $67 billion in gains last year, a big jump from the year before.\n",
      "18\n",
      "Many modern cars are internet-connected and have apps that allow an owner to see a car’s location, turn it on remotely, honk its horn and even adjust the temperature. These apps for car control and tracking are designed for convenience, but a New York Times article last month detailed how they have been weaponized in abusive relationships, allowing for unwanted stalking and harassment. \n",
      " The Federal Communications Commission is concerned about abusive partners using connected car apps to harass and track their victims.\n",
      "19\n",
      "As Teslas and other electric vehicles dazzled car buyers with futuristic technology and dreams of a gasoline-free future, hybrid cars began to seem like yesterday’s news. Sales of the Toyota Prius, the standard-bearer for hybrids, fell 85 percent over a decade. \n",
      " Automakers like Ford, Kia and Toyota are offering more hybrid options to appeal to buyers who aren’t ready for fully electric vehicles.\n",
      "20\n",
      "General Motors said on Tuesday that its profit in the final three months of 2023 was depressed by the cost of a 40-day strike at some of its U.S. plants and an accounting charge related to electric vehicles. \n",
      " The automaker has placed a bet on electric vehicles, but it has struggled to produce and sell the vehicles in large numbers.\n",

      "22\n",
      "The effort to pick anyone but Donald Trump as the Republican presidential nominee took another big, if expected, blow on Sunday when Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race and endorsed the former president.
