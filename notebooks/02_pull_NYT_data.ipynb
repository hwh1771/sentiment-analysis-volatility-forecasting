      "2\n",
      "Tesla’s profit from sales of electric cars slumped in the last three months of last year because of price cuts intended to thwart increasingly intense competition, the company said on Wednesday as it warned of a tough year ahead. \n",
      " A tax benefit boosted quarterly earnings, but that masked a decline in earnings from carmaking caused by intensifying competition.\n",

      "6\n",
      "The rental car company Hertz will be selling about one-third of the electric vehicles in its fleet after they lost value more quickly than expected, the company said on Thursday. The drop in value is a blow to the company’s efforts to replace gasoline vehicles with cars that do not produce tailpipe emissions. \n",
      " The rental car company blamed the sharp drop in the value of electric vehicles and higher repair costs for its decision to sell 20,000 cars.\n",
      "7\n",
      "Tesla sales jumped during the last three months of 2023 after the carmaker slashed prices and customers rushed to take advantage of tax breaks on electric vehicles — provisions that will be harder to come by in 2024. \n",

      " Sales by BYD, the country’s dominant automaker, topped 3 million last year, including 1.6 million fully battery-powered cars. It’s a sign of China’s rapid growth in EVs.\n",
      "12\n",
      "There are more than four million electric vehicles on American roads, but fewer than 1,000 of them are heavy-duty trucks.

      " The resignation of Claudine Gay as Harvard’s president reopens the debate over who should run America’s elite universities.\n",
      "15\n",

      "18\n",
      "Many modern cars are internet-connected and have apps that allow an owner to see a car’s location, turn it on remotely, honk its horn and even adjust the temperature. These apps for car control and tracking are designed for convenience, but a New York Times article last month detailed how they have been weaponized in abusive relationships, allowing for unwanted stalking and harassment. \n",

      "20\n",
